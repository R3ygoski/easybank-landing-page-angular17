## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SCSS custom properties
- SCSS Mixins
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular 17](https://angular.dev/) - JS Framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

This marked my inaugural venture with the Angular Framework. While it initially posed challenges, over time, clarity dawned, making tasks more manageable and comprehensible. I thoroughly enjoyed navigating Angular 17's intricacies, and I aspire to elevate it to a primary focus, following my current exploration with NextTS.
